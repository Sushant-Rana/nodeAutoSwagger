# swagger-autogen

## Overview

This module performs automatic construction of Swagger documentation. It can identify the endpoints and automatically capture methods such as get, post, put, and so on. It also identifies paths, routes, middlewares, response status codes, parameters in the path, header, query and body. It is possible to add information such as endpoint description, parameter description, schemas, security, among others using comments in code. At the end, it generates the *.json* file containing the Swagger format specification.

## Issues

Due to the number of open issues and the lack of time to respond with quality, I've disabled the opening of issues for now. I'm still keeping my eyes on the project and I intend to prioritize the issues already open. Once I have closed a satisfactory number of issues, I will open it again. Thank you for understanding.
