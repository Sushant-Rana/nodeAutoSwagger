# Authentication

It is possible to define authentication to endpoints. The following are some examples, but a complete approach can be seen on the website [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
